# Crime Stats
This project gives the user a visual representation of crimes committed by offense and shows a comparison of the number of crimes committed per offense between the nation and a state of the user's choice.

## Getting Started
Crime Stats is available online now at http://crime-stats-app.herokuapp.com/. You will immediately see data for crimes commited on a national level between the years of 1979 and 2018! To compare crimes committed on a national level, meaning the rates for all 50 states, versus a single state, simply go to the dropdown on the top and select which state you want to compare.
